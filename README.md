# Quick and Dirty Telecine
After finding some old Super 8 film rolls after my uncle, I decided that they needed to be digitized.
There are a lot of guides on the net describing how to build a Telecine, but most of them used projector or parts from old camera.
Sine I have none of these, I decided to build one from what I have , Raspberry PI 4 with camera, some Makerbeam profiles and bearings, some cheap 5V stepper.
Other parts are printed on my 3D printer.

## Disadvantages

* Slow - it takes picture to detect if sprock is in right position
* Manual takeup spool
